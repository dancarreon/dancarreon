- ðŸ‘‹ Hi everyone, Iâ€™m @dancarreon
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a Sofware Engineer mainly focused on Back End technologies but also have gained quite experience managing projects and additionally I've been trying to get into Front End too!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning some things that are not related to engineering! Just to keep my mind open
- ðŸ“« Want to see what have I done? Well, besides my professional experience I've done some teaching stuff and puzzles that I do on my free time, here are some of the sites where you can see my experience/work:
